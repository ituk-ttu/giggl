1. Run the node app with `npm start`

2. Visit `localhost:1337/player` on the same device or `ip:1337/player` on a LAN-connected device where `ip` is the
local IP-address of the device where the node app was started. Example: `192.168.0.3:1337/player`

3. Similarly to `/player` for playing the songs, visit `/client` on any device to be the DJ
